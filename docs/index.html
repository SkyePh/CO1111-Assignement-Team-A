    <h1>Team A's Assignment for CO1111</h1>
    <h2>Meet the team</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Marios Philippou: Team Leader & Javascript Developer</li>
        <li>Mark Kislenko: Javascript Developer</li>
        <li>Rafael Zavros: Frontend Developer</li>
        <li>Nikoletta Louka: Frontend Developer & Marketing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What we created</h2>
    <p>We have been tasked with creating a Treasure Hunt Quiz solution that follows modern UI/UX design standards and
        sound software engineering practices. To achieve the best possible outcome, we divided the team into clearly defined roles,
        with each member responsible for a specific part of the overall task. This approach allowed everyone to remain actively
        involved and complete their work efficiently while collaborating in parallel. As a result, our teamwork
        led to improved productivity, better coordination, and a smoother development process overall. </p>
